# Code review notes

## Beginner

- [ ] Simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. (Keep it simple).
- [ ] Code is not repeated or duplicated. No sign for copy-paste-development.Â  (Don't repeat yourself).
- [ ] No code can be replaced with library functions (Don't reinvent the wheel).
- [ ] There is no commented out code.
- [ ] There is no dead code.
- [ ] No empty blocks of code.
- [ ] No complex/long boolean expressions.
- [ ] Variables defined close to where they are used. (in methods only).
- [ ] All class, variable, and method modifiers are correct.
- [ ] There are no usages of 'magic numbers' (use enums or constans instead).
