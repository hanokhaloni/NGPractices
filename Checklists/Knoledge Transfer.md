# Team structure:

- Members of the team
- Hierarchy and responsibilities, reporting
- The customer's / related teams' / vendor's contacts

# Business requirements, trying to get access to:

- Description of business requirements
- - What is the functionality the software enables?
- - What are the stakeholders concerns and how the software full-fills these concerns?
- User documentation
- Test cases

# Source code:

- Repository URLs
- Creating accounts with the required rights
- Getting all configuration scripts and requirements for developers' workstations
- If possible, creating automated scripts of environment deployment or creating system images – to save precious time for the developers.
- general overview of components and their dependencies

# Technical documentation:

- System architecture
- Sub-system architecture
- Databases structure
- Architecture in terms of technical primitives
- Architecture in terms of business tasks, use cases
- Team's technical debts
- All technical findings and proposals regarding the existing system
- ADR design decisions (a nice level of decisions and a check-list for this can be found at P&P)
- What system quality attributes have identified and addressed how ?
- security
- third party tooling used

It is possible to carry out an experiment: ask the new team to create a "pattern" of the system with the purpose of identifying infrastructure components that ensure the system's operability, and superimpose business requirements on that – judging by my experience, people catch on the project much quicker.

# Delivery and environment system:

- CI/CD servers
- Test infrastructure
- Build versions
- Deployment strategies
- - The purpose of machine depended configuration settings
- - how the install the software?
- - how to roll the software back?

# Information systems (very important):

- User requests handling system
- Bug tracking system

# Knowledge base system / information portal

- How to get a new developer started
- Monitoring system
- User actions analytics system
- It is crucial to identify contact persons for all issues regarding each system
- Also all procedures and ceremonials: flow processing of user requests; flow approvals of new technical documentation

# Processes and a list of decision makers (DM):

- Procedures and a list of DMs connected with daily routines
- Procedures and a list of DMs connected with closing a sprint / iteration / work stage
- Procedures and a list of DMs connected with planning a new release / iteration
- Procedures connected with handling Change Requests, and a list of DMs
- Procedures and ceremonials connected with issuing a new release

# Testing, quality assurance team:

- Necessary to get access to all test script databases
- Necessary to get the description of release issue procedures

# User accounts – I bring them out, to keep in mind:

- Testing / staging / production user accounts for testing the product
- Accounts in the analytics / vendors / partners systems

# Field of action:

- Work plan
- Roadmap
- Objectives definition in technical terms
- Objectives definition in terms of product

# Third party services, vendors, partners:

- Access to all third party systems with admin rights – to be able to add your own users
- Contacts of all vendors and partners, their DMs, interaction schedule, their team structure, responsibilities, and a brief description of the interaction domain and the team's objectives

# The "Objectives" Section is very important:

- What is required from the development, testing, and support teams?
- What are the objectives of the new team?
